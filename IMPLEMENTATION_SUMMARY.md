# Implementation Summary

## Changes Requested & Completed

### 1. ✅ Local File Input Support

**Request:** "Give the option to choose from a txt or word file in a folder (the command line will ask for name of the file)"

**Implementation:**
- Added support for reading from local .txt and .docx files
- Interactive prompt asks user to choose between URL (web scraping) or local file
- When local file is chosen, prompts for file path
- Command-line argument: `--file <path>`

**New Functions:**
- `read_text_file(file_path)` - Reads plain text files
- `read_docx_file(file_path)` - Reads Word documents (requires python-docx)
- `read_local_file(file_path)` - Main dispatcher function
- `prompt_input_source()` - Interactive source selection

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py
# Choose option 2 (Local file)
# Enter file path when prompted

# Command-line
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py --file bibliography.txt --out output.json
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py --file bibliography.docx --out output.json
```

**Dependencies:**
- Optional: `python-docx` (install with `pip install python-docx`)

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Failed Entries File

**Request:** "Can you create a txt file with the entries that it wasn't able to add to the JSON file"

**Implementation:**
- Replaced basic `failed.txt` with detailed `failed_entries.txt`
- Includes header with total count and explanation
- Each failed entry is numbered and separated for easy reading
- Provides guidance on what to do with failed entries

**Format:**
```
================================================================================
FAILED BIBLIOGRAPHY ENTRIES
================================================================================
Total failed entries: 3
These entries could not be parsed by the LLM and were added as stub records.
Consider re-processing them individually or manually adding them to Zotero.
================================================================================

1. First failed entry text here...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Second failed entry text here...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**What Happens:**
1. Failed entries are still added to the JSON/RIS output as stub records
2. They're also logged to `failed_entries.txt` for manual review
3. Stub records contain the raw citation text in the `title` field
4. A note explains that parsing failed

## Files Modified

### omeka_bib_to_zotero.py
- Added imports: `Path` from `pathlib`, optional `Document` from `docx`
- Added `read_text_file()`, `read_docx_file()`, `read_local_file()` functions
- Modified `prompt_input_source()` (was `prompt_url()`) to support both sources
- Updated `main()` to handle `--file` argument and source type detection
- Enhanced failed entries writing with detailed formatting
- Updated docstring with new usage examples

### CLAUDE.md
- Updated overview to mention local file support
- Added optional dependency: python-docx
- Added examples for local file usage
- Updated output files section (failed_entries.txt instead of failed.txt)
- Added note about input file format requirements

### New Files Created

1. **NEW_FEATURES.md** - Comprehensive guide to new features
2. **test_bibliography.txt** - Sample test file
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Testing Performed

✅ **Local file input test:**
```bash
# Created test file with 5 entries separated by triple newlines
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py --file test_bibliography.txt --out test_file_output2.json --max 10

# Result: Successfully read 5 entries
# Author ditto marks properly expanded
# Output verified correct
```

✅ **Failed entries tracking:**
- Verified file is created when LLM parsing fails
- Checked formatting and structure
- Confirmed stub records are added to output JSON

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing functionality preserved:
- `--url` argument still works
- Interactive URL prompting still works (choose option 1)
- All LLM features unchanged
- Output formats unchanged
- Entry splitting and author expansion unchanged

## User Experience Improvements

1. **More flexible input** - Can now process bibliographies from any source
2. **Better failure tracking** - Clear, formatted list of entries that need manual attention
3. **Clearer prompts** - Interactive mode clearly distinguishes between URL and file input
4. **Better documentation** - Updated CLAUDE.md and new NEW_FEATURES.md guide

## Command-Line Examples

### URL Input (Original)
```bash
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py --url https://example.com/bibliography --out output.json
```

### Local File Input (New)
```bash
# Text file
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py --file bibliography.txt --out output.json

# Word document
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py --file bibliography.docx --out output.json

# With LLM parsing
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py \
  --file bibliography.txt \
  --use-llm openai \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --out output.json
```

### Interactive Mode (Enhanced)
```bash
python omeka_bib_to_zotero.py
# Prompts:
#   1. Choose input source (URL or local file) <- NEW
#   2. Enter URL or file path               <- NEW (was just URL)
#   3. Choose output format
#   4. Enter output file name
#   5. Choose LLM provider
#   6. Enter model name
#   7. Enter API key
#   8. Enter max entries
```

## Notes for Future Development

- The `split_entries()` function expects triple-newline separators
- For local files, users should format their bibliographies accordingly
- Word documents are read paragraph-by-paragraph and joined with double newlines
- The `python-docx` library is optional but recommended for .docx support
- Failed entries are tracked throughout the LLM parsing process in the `failed` list
- Both partial batches and complete failures are logged to `failed_entries.txt`

## Success Metrics

✅ Both requested features fully implemented
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Code tested and working
✅ Documentation updated
✅ User experience improved
